        <h3>Climate components in the Arctic</h3>
        <p>
          The Arctic is characterised by distinct components consisting of water
          in frozen form: glaciers, snow, permafrost and iced-over water. These
          components together form the cryosphere. All parts of the cryosphere
          are sensitive to climate change, and they all play important roles in
          the global climate system.
        </p>
        <h3>Accelerated Arctic Warming and its Consequences</h3>
        <p>
          The arctic is warming around twice as fast as global average. Some of
          the reasons for this are: The arctic amplification, the albedo effect,
          and black carbon. From 1979 to 1996, we lost 2.2 â€“ 3% of the arctic
          ice cover. From 2010 to present we are losing 12.85% per decade!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another consequence is permafrost thawing. This is a process in which
          large amounts of methane is released to the atmosphere, fueling more
          the process of global warming.
