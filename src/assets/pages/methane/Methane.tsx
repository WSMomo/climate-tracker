        <h3>Methane Emissions</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Methane is a flammable gas formed by geological and biological
          processes. Some of the natural ones are leaks from natural gas systems
          and wetlands.
        </p>
        <p>
          50-65% of total global methane emissions come from human activities.
          These include livestock, agriculture, oil and gas systems, waste from
          homes and businesses, landfills, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methane is a gas with a global warming potential several times
          stronger than of CO2. For more than 650,000 years, methane
          concentration in the atmosphere was between 350 â€“ 800 ppb. From the
          beginning of the industrial revolution, human activities have
          increased this amount by around 150%.
