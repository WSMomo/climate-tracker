  "p_first": "The Arctic is characterised by distinct components consisting of water in frozen form: glaciers, snow, permafrost and iced-over water. These components together form the cryosphere. All parts of the cryosphere are sensitive to climate change, and they all play important roles in the global climate system.",
  "h3_second": "Accelerated Arctic Warming and its Consequences",
  "p_second": "The arctic is warming around twice as fast as global average. Some of the reasons for this are: The arctic amplification, the albedo effect, and black carbon. From 1979 to 1996, we lost 2.2 - 3% of the arctic ice cover. From 2010 to present we are losing 12.85% per decade!",
  "p_third": "Another consequence is permafrost thawing. This is a process in which large amounts of methane is released to the atmosphere, fueling more the process of global warming.",
