  "p_first": "CO2 is a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun and therefore makes the Earth warmer. If nothing changes, global atmospheric CO2-concentrations could reach 550 parts per million (ppm) in 2050 - the “business as usual” scenario.\n\nHistorically, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been 2-300 ppm. This was the level for tens of thousands of years. But since the beginning of the industrial revolution around 1760, CO2-levels have skyrocketed, reaching almost 420 ppm in 2021. The highest level of CO2 in 14 million years.",

  "p_second": "The reason for the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations? Well, take a wild guess. Despite good intentions and ambitious goals, human generated CO2-emissions keep going up.\n\nIn a business-as-usual scenario, global CO2 emissions are projected to reach 43 billion tons in 2050 (compared to 35 billion tons in 2018).",
